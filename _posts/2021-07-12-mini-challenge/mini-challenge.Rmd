## Synopsis of the Problem:

![](IMG/MC2.png)

### Many of the Abila, Kronos-based employees of GAStech have company cars which are approved for both personal and business use. Those who do not have company cars have the ability to check out company trucks for business use, but these trucks cannot be used for personal business.
   
### Employees with company cars are happy to have these vehicles, because the company cars are generally much higher quality than the cars they would be able to afford otherwise. However, GAStech does not trust their employees. Without the employees? knowledge, GAStech has installed geospatial tracking software in the company vehicles. The vehicles are tracked periodically as long as they are moving.
    
### This vehicle tracking data has been made available to law enforcement to support their investigation. Unfortunately, data is not available for the day the GAStech employees went missing. Data is only available for the two weeks prior to the disappearance.

### To promote local businesses, Kronos based companies provide a Kronos Kares benefit card to GASTech employees giving them discounts and rewards in exchange for collecting information about their credit card purchases and preferences as recorded on loyalty cards. This data has been made available to investigators in the hopes that it can help resolve the situation. However, Kronos Kares does not collect personal information beyond purchases.

### As a visual analytics expert assisting law enforcement, your mission is to identify which GASTech employees made which purchases and identify suspicious patterns of behavior. You must cope with uncertainties that result from missing, conflicting, and imperfect data to make recommendations for further investigation.

### Use visual analytics to analyze the available data and develop responses to the questions below. In addition, prepare a video that shows how you used visual analytics to solve this challenge. 
    
### *Background*
### This scenario and all the people, places, groups, technologies, contained therein are fictitious. Any resemblance to real people, places, groups, or technologies is purely coincidental.

### Packages Used:

readr, readxl, ggplot2, dplyr, ggiraph



____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
### 1. Using just the credit and loyalty card data, identify the most popular locations, and when they are popular. What anomalies do you see? What corrections would you recommend to correct these anomalies? Please limit your answer to 8 images and 300 words.


Based on the visual plots created suing absolute count, we can check with locations had the highest numbers based of the loyalty and credit card data.
Additionally, we can check which locations had the highest spending based on the boxplots created.
Box-plots are a great way to identify the outliers (anomalies) which may indicate suspicious activities.
Further investigation would be required once we identify these outliers.

As an immediate step, we would import the cc_data and loyalty_data to our R Studio.
The loyalty data has 1392 rows and cr_card data has 1490 rows. This suggests that a 1-1 mapping may not be available. We would need to join the data sets to identify the relationship.

```{r}
cc_data <- read_csv("data/MC2/cc_data.csv")
```
```{r}
loyalty_data <- read_csv("data/MC2/loyalty_data.csv")
```
```{r}
loyalty_data %>%
  count(location, sort = TRUE)
```

```{r}
cc_data %>%
  count(location, sort = TRUE)
```

#Create a boxplot to check for places with highest credit card spending based on Cr Card Data.

```{r}
ggplot(cc_data, aes(x=location, y=price))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  scale_y_log10()
```

#Create a barplot showing median cr card spending by location

```{r}
ggplot(cc_data, aes(x=location, y=price))+
  geom_col()
```












#Creating a Boxplot to check which locations were visited most based on Loyalty Data.

```{r}
ggplot(loyalty_data, aes(x=location, y=price))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  scale_y_log10()
```

#Creating a Boxplot to check which loyalty numbers had the highest spending.
```{r}
ggplot(loyalty_data, aes(x=loyaltynum, y=price))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  scale_y_log10()
```

### 2. Add the vehicle data to your analysis of the credit and loyalty card data. How does your assessment of the anomalies in question 1 change based on this new data? What discrepancies between vehicle, credit, and loyalty card data do you find? Please limit your answer to 8 images and 500 words.

```{r}
car_data <- read_csv("data/MC2/car-assignments.csv")
```

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
### 3. Can you infer the owners of each credit card and loyalty card? What is your evidence? Where are there uncertainties in your method? Where are there uncertainties in the data? Please limit your answer to 8 images and 500 words.


____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
### 4. Given the data sources provided, identify potential informal or unofficial relationships among GASTech personnel. Provide evidence for these relationships. Please limit your response to 8 images and 500 words.


____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
### 5. Do you see evidence of suspicious activity? Identify 1- 10 locations where you believe the suspicious activity is occurring, and why Please limit your response to 10 images and 500 words.

```{r}
Abila_st <- st_read(dsn = "data/MC2/Geospatial",
                    layer = "Abila")
```

```{r}
gps <- read_csv("data/MC2/gps.csv")
glimpse(gps)
```
