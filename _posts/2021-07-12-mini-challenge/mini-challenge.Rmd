## Synopsis of the Problem:

![](IMG/MC2.png)

### Many of the Abila, Kronos-based employees of GAStech have company cars which are approved for both personal and business use. Those who do not have company cars have the ability to check out company trucks for business use, but these trucks cannot be used for personal business.
   
### Employees with company cars are happy to have these vehicles, because the company cars are generally much higher quality than the cars they would be able to afford otherwise. However, GAStech does not trust their employees. Without the employees? knowledge, GAStech has installed geospatial tracking software in the company vehicles. The vehicles are tracked periodically as long as they are moving.
    
### This vehicle tracking data has been made available to law enforcement to support their investigation. Unfortunately, data is not available for the day the GAStech employees went missing. Data is only available for the two weeks prior to the disappearance.

### To promote local businesses, Kronos based companies provide a Kronos Kares benefit card to GASTech employees giving them discounts and rewards in exchange for collecting information about their credit card purchases and preferences as recorded on loyalty cards. This data has been made available to investigators in the hopes that it can help resolve the situation. However, Kronos Kares does not collect personal information beyond purchases.

### As a visual analytics expert assisting law enforcement, your mission is to identify which GASTech employees made which purchases and identify suspicious patterns of behavior. You must cope with uncertainties that result from missing, conflicting, and imperfect data to make recommendations for further investigation.

### Use visual analytics to analyze the available data and develop responses to the questions below. In addition, prepare a video that shows how you used visual analytics to solve this challenge. 
    
### *Background*
### This scenario and all the people, places, groups, technologies, contained therein are fictitious. Any resemblance to real people, places, groups, or technologies is purely coincidental.

# Packages Installation and Data Import

```{r echo=TRUE}
packages = c('tidytext', 'widyr',
              'wordcloud', 'DT',
              'textplot','lubridate',
              'hms','tidyverse',
              'tidygraph','ggraph',

              'plotly', 'ggplot2',
              'readr', 'readxl',
              'network')

for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```
....................................................................................................................
# Importing Files & Reading Them:

As an immediate step, we would import the cc_data and loyalty_data to our R Studio.The loyalty data has 1392 rows and cr_card data has 1490 rows. This suggests that a 1-1 mapping may not be available. Irrespective, we can use the count function to count the popular destinations from the 2 data sets.

```{r echo=TRUE}
ccard <- "data/MC2/"
cc_data <- read_csv("data/MC2/cc_data.csv")
loyalty_data <- read_csv("data/MC2/loyalty_data.csv")
car_data <- read_csv("data/MC2/car-assignments.csv")
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
read_folder <- function(infolder) {
   tibble(file = dir(infolder,
                      full.names = TRUE)) %>%
    mutate(text = map(file,
                      read_lines)) %>%
    transmute(id= basename(file),
              text) %>%
    unnest(text)
}
```

....................................................................................................................
# Data Cleansing and Preparation:
1) We have changed Katerina's Cafe to Katerina Cafe as there are formatting issues in reading the string values.

```{r echo=TRUE}
cc_data <- cc_data %>%
  mutate(location = str_replace_all(location,
                                    pattern = "Katerin.+",
                                    replacement = "Katrina\x27s Caf\xe9"))
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
loyalty_data <- loyalty_data %>%
  mutate(location = str_replace_all(location,
                                    pattern = "Katerin.+",
                                    replacement = "Katrina\x27s Caf\xe9"))
```

....................................................................................................................

2) Convert timestamp from character column into date & time format using the below code:

```{r echo=TRUE}
cc_data$timestamp <- date_time_parse(cc_data$timestamp,
                                     zone = "",
                                     format = "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M")
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
loyalty_data$timestamp <- date_time_parse(loyalty_data$timestamp,
                                     zone = "",
                                     format = "%m/%d/%Y")
```

....................................................................................................................

# The Visual Detective at Work:
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
## 1. Using just the credit and loyalty card data, identify the most popular locations, and when they are popular. What anomalies do you see? What corrections would you recommend to correct these anomalies? Please limit your answer to 8 images and 300 words.

### 1.1 Popularity of the Locations.

On the visual plots created using absolute count, we can check with locations had the highest numbers based of the loyalty and credit card data.
Additionally, we can check which locations had the highest spending based on the boxplots created.
Box-plots are a great way to identify the outliers (anomalies) which may indicate suspicious activities.
Further investigation would be required once we identify these outliers.

```{r echo=TRUE}
loyalty_data %>%
  count(location, sort = TRUE)
```
....................................................................................................................

```{r echo=TRUE}
cc_data %>%
  count(location, sort = TRUE)
```
....................................................................................................................
*Analysis:*

1) Based on the credit card transactions, *Katerina Cafe, Hippokampos, Guy's Gyros and Brew've Been Served* are popular locations which were frequented by the GASTECH employees.

2) Based on the loyalty data, *Katerina Cafe, Hippokampos, Guy's Gyros and Brew've Been Served* are popular locations which were frequented by the GASTECH employees.

....................................................................................................................

### 1.2 Create a boxplot to check for places with highest credit card spending based on Cr Card Data.

```{r echo=TRUE}
ggplot(cc_data, aes(x=location, y=price))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  scale_y_log10()
```

### 1.3 Create a barplot showing cr card spending by location

```{r echo=TRUE}
ggplot(cc_data, aes(x=location, y=price, sort = TRUE))+
  geom_col()
```

### 1.4 Creating a Boxplot to check which locations were visited most based on Loyalty Data.

```{r echo=TRUE}
ggplot(loyalty_data, aes(x=location, y=price))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  scale_y_log10()
```

### 1.5 Creating a Boxplot to check which loyalty numbers had the highest spending.
```{r echo=TRUE}
ggplot(loyalty_data, aes(x=loyaltynum, y=price))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  scale_y_log10()
```
The above 2 data sets coincide to reflect that the above ae the 4 popular destinations which are frequented by the GAStech employees. However, we are checking for anomalies in the data suggesting suspicious behavior.
Since the employees were given a corporate credit card, it is expected for them to use it during the weekday and not weekends. We will deep dive further on the transaction patters for weekday and weekends to deduce the behavior further.

We will create a heatmap to check on the timings where transaction was the highest. That would provide us with insight on the anomalies of the spending habits.

### 1.6 Heatmap Creation

```{r}
heatmap_cc <- cc_data %>%
  mutate(time60 = round_date(cc_data$timestamp, "60 minutes"),
         daydate = weekdays(timestamp),
         tempdate = timestamp + 8*60*60,
         weekend = chron::is.weekend(tempdate),
         time = format(time60, format = "%H:%M")) %>%
  select(-c(tempdate)) %>%
  group_by(location, daydate, time) %>%
  add_count(location, daydate, time, name = "count")
```

```{r}
heatmap_cc_weekday <- heatmap_cc %>%
  filter(weekend == FALSE)
```

```{r}
pop_heatmap_cc_weekday <- heatmap_cc %>%
  filter(location == "Abila Zacharo"|
           location =="Brew've Been Served" |

           location == "Guy's Gyros" |
           location == "Hallowed Grounds" |
