Using just the credit and loyalty card data, identify the most popular locations, and when they are popular. What anomalies do you see? What corrections would you recommend to correct these anomalies? Please limit your answer to 8 images and 300 words.\r\n1.1 Popularity of the Locations.\r\nOn the visual plots created using absolute count, we can check with locations had the highest numbers based of the loyalty and credit card data. Additionally, we can check which locations had the highest spending based on the boxplots created. Box-plots are a great way to identify the outliers (anomalies) which may indicate suspicious activities. Further investigation would be required once we identify these outliers.\r\n\r\n\r\nloyalty_data %>%\r\n  count(location, sort = TRUE)\r\n\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 33 x 2\r\n   location                 n\r\n   <chr>                <int>\r\n 1 Katrina's Café         195\r\n 2 Hippokampos            155\r\n 3 Guy's Gyros            146\r\n 4 Brew've Been Served    140\r\n 5 Ouzeri Elian            84\r\n 6 Hallowed Grounds        80\r\n 7 Abila Zacharo           71\r\n 8 Kalami Kafenion         66\r\n 9 Gelatogalore            60\r\n10 Bean There Done That    45\r\n# ... with 23 more rows\r\n\r\n……………………………………………………………………………………………………..\r\n\r\n\r\ncc_data %>%\r\n  count(location, sort = TRUE)\r\n\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 34 x 2\r\n   location                 n\r\n   <chr>                <int>\r\n 1 Katrina's Café         212\r\n 2 Hippokampos            171\r\n 3 Guy's Gyros            158\r\n 4 Brew've Been Served    156\r\n 5 Hallowed Grounds        92\r\n 6 Ouzeri Elian            87\r\n 7 Abila Zacharo           72\r\n 8 Gelatogalore            64\r\n 9 Kalami Kafenion         64\r\n10 Bean There Done That    47\r\n# ... with 24 more rows\r\n\r\n……………………………………………………………………………………………………..\r\nAnalysis:\r\nBased on the credit card transactions, Katerina’s Cafe, Hippokampos, Guy’s Gyros and Brew’ve Been Served are popular locations which were frequented by the GASTECH employees.\r\nBased on the loyalty data, Katerina’s Cafe, Hippokampos, Guy’s Gyros and Brew’ve Been Served are popular locations which were frequented by the GASTECH employees.\r\n……………………………………………………………………………………………………..\r\n1.2 Create a boxplot to check for places with highest credit card spending based on Cr Card Data.\r\n\r\n\r\nggplot(cc_data, aes(x=location, y=price))+\r\n  geom_boxplot()+\r\n  scale_y_log10()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3 Create a barplot showing cr card spending by location\r\n\r\n\r\nggplot(cc_data, aes(x=location, y=price, sort = TRUE))+\r\n  geom_col()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4 Creating a Boxplot to check which locations were visited most based on Loyalty Data.\r\n\r\n\r\nggplot(loyalty_data, aes(x=location, y=price))+\r\n  geom_boxplot()+\r\n  scale_y_log10()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.5 Creating a Boxplot to check which loyalty numbers had the highest spending.\r\n\r\n\r\nggplot(loyalty_data, aes(x=loyaltynum, y=price))+\r\n  geom_boxplot()+\r\n  scale_y_log10()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above 2 data sets coincide to reflect that the above ae the 4 popular destinations which are frequented by the GAStech employees. However, we are checking for anomalies in the data suggesting suspicious behavior. Since the employees were given a corporate credit card, it is expected for them to use it during the weekday and not weekends. We will deep dive further on the transaction patters for weekday and weekends to deduce the behavior further.\r\nWe will create a heatmap to check on the timings where transaction was the highest. That would provide us with insight on the anomalies of the spending habits.\r\n1.6 Heatmap Creation\r\nThe below steps allow us to identify id the credit card transaction done was on a weekday or weekend. It is the first filter applied on our data based on the timestamp column. Thereafter, we are counting the transactions under each location to form a heatmap.\r\nWD = Weekday WE = Weekend CC = Credit Card Loyalty = Loyalty Data\r\nUsing Credit Card Data - for both day and time.\r\n\r\n\r\nheatmap_cc <- cc_data %>%\r\n  mutate(time60 = round_date(cc_data$timestamp, \"60 minutes\"),\r\n      daydate = weekdays(timestamp),\r\n      tempdate = timestamp + 8*60*60,\r\n      weekend = chron::is.weekend(tempdate),\r\n      time = format(time60, format = \"%H:%M\")) %>%\r\n  select(-c(tempdate)) %>%\r\n  group_by(location, daydate, time) %>%\r\n  add_count(location, daydate, time, name = \"count\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nheatmap_cc_weekday <- heatmap_cc %>%\r\n  filter(weekend == FALSE)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncount_heatmap_cc_weekday <- heatmap_cc %>%\r\n  filter(location == \"Abila Zacharo\"|\r\n           location ==\"Brew've Been Served\" |\r\n           location == \"Gelatogalore\" |\r\n           location == \"Guy's Gyros\" |\r\n           location == \"Hallowed Grounds\" |\r\n           location == \"Hippokampos\" |\r\n           location == \"Katrina's Café\" |\r\n           location == \"Kalami Kafenion\" |\r\n           location ==\"Ouzeri Elian\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nheatmap_cc_weekend <- heatmap_cc %>%\r\n  filter(weekend == TRUE)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncount_heatmap_cc_weekend <- heatmap_cc %>%\r\n  filter(location == \"Kalami Kafenion\"|\r\n           location == \"Guy's Gyros\" |\r\n           location == \"Hippokampos\" |\r\n           location == \"Katrina's Café\" |\r\n           location == \"Ouzeri Elian\" |\r\n           location == \"Abila Zacharo\"|\r\n           location == \"Brew've Been Served\" |\r\n           location == \"Gelatogalore\" |\r\n           location == \"Hallowed Grounds\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWD <- length(unique(heatmap_cc_weekday$count))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncc_colour_A <- colorRampPalette(c('blue', 'green', 'yellow', 'red'))(WD)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC1 <- ggplot(heatmap_cc_weekday,\r\n       aes(location, time)) + \r\n  geom_tile(aes(fill = factor(count))) + \r\n  scale_fill_manual(values = cc_colour_A,\r\n                    name = \"Frequency\") +\r\n                    #breaks = levels(count)[seq(1, x, by = 5)]) +\r\n  labs(x = \"Locations\", y = \"Time (Static)\", title = \"Number of CCard Transactions during Weekdays\") +\r\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, vjust = 1.1, hjust = 1.1),\r\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7),\r\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA1 <- length(unique(count_heatmap_cc_weekday$count))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC2 <- colorRampPalette(c('blue', 'green', 'yellow', 'red'))(A1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC3 <- ggplot(count_heatmap_cc_weekday,\r\n       aes(location, time)) + \r\n  geom_tile(aes(fill = factor(count))) + \r\n  scale_fill_manual(values = cc_colour_A,\r\n                    name = \"Frequency\") +\r\n                    #breaks = levels(count)[seq(1, x, by = 5)]) +\r\n  labs(x = \"Locations\", y = \"Time (Static)\", title = \"Number of CCard Transactions during Weekdays\") +\r\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, vjust = 1.1, hjust = 1.1),\r\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7),\r\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWE <- length(unique(heatmap_cc_weekend$count))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing Loyalty Data - for both day and time.\r\n\r\n\r\nheatmap_loyalty <- loyalty_data %>%\r\n  mutate(daydate = weekdays(timestamp),\r\n      tempdate = timestamp + 8*60*60,\r\n      weekend = chron::is.weekend(tempdate),\r\n      date = format(timestamp, format = \"%m/%d/%Y\")) %>%\r\n  select(-c(tempdate)) %>%\r\n  group_by(location, date) %>%\r\n  add_count(location, date, name = \"count\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nheatmap_loyalty_weekday <- heatmap_loyalty %>%\r\n  filter(weekend == FALSE)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nheatmap_loyalty_weekend <- heatmap_loyalty %>%\r\n  filter(weekend == TRUE)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL1 <- length(unique(heatmap_loyalty_weekday$count))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

Looking at the data sheet, we notice that the data sheet is labeled in Bahasa Indonesia.\r\nTab 1 is a district wise data (nama_kota) which is bifurcated by village name (nama_kelurahan).\r\nTab 2 is aggregated district wise data.\r\nFor easy reference and understanding, we will translate the key words into English (only for data which is available by each district).\r\nThere are columns with no data by district. We will not use these columns for our analysis.\r\nThere is an entry on Proces Update Data and Luar DKI Jakarta which does not sound like a city / district name. We will not retain them in our analysis as we do not know what this means. They seem lke an aggregated data.\r\nPopulation data is not provided making it difficult for us to compare if the covid cases and death toll is in line with the population figures.\r\nLiterature Review\r\nLiterature review of current visualizations on COVID-19 deaths worldwide. There are many websites that show the incremental data on a daily basis. Most visualizations are line graphs (time series data) as they talk about the progress over a period of time. The next popular visualization is geo-spatial graph where the websites show graphic data by country on how severely it is hit by Covid.\r\nAdditionally now, countries are actively reporting vaccine status by adding daily updates to fully vaccinated vs partially vaccinated counts. This is helping many countries plan their supplies and arrangements in the event of adverse effects of the virus.\r\nAccolades\r\nhttps://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/\r\nhttps://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19\r\nhttps://data.humdata.org/visualization/covid19-humanitarian-operations/?ga1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw9O6HBhCrARIsADx5qCQm7nerudHtAIdWvgDXFTjdn8g_0bng0u78_5eLdcnKd7PPVm7BEmMaAupiEALw_wcB\\\r\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations\r\nWe are reviewing DKI JAKARTA data only as of 30th June 2021. It is a snapshot data and has very limited information provided (by district level).\r\nAdding some visualizations below that are popular methods of showcasing the current data and the trends. While the below are time series and geo-spatial data charts, they are most useful when describing visuals related to a pandemic. Since we do not have time or map data, we would rely on simple charts to showcase the effects of the virus in DKI JAKARTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Task\r\n1. Critic the data visualisation from both its clarity and aesthetics. At least three from each evaluation criterion\r\nClarity\r\nThe chart is quite cluttered due to multiple districts shown. The entire data set is huge and hence a plot chart loses focus on what it is trying to show. It would be easier to use a plot chart to represent only the top 5 district and not the entire data set.\r\n……………………………………………………………………………………………………..\r\nThe comparison of the data for dots which are closer to each other is difficult to compare and analyse.This is because they appear very close and hence, the difference is not easily visualized.\r\n……………………………………………………………………………………………………..\r\nThe bar graph should be scaled to show the numbers starting from 1000 as the entire chart looks too big given the large values. That would easily showcase the differences in numbers. Considering that the total number of Cities are just 8, showing top 5 is of no use. It would be good to compare all 8 of them (including the proces update data).\r\n……………………………………………………………………………………………………..\r\nThe average number of cumulative deaths in the bar graph is a misleading number - It is either an average or a cumulative, not sure what does an average cumulative figure represents.If we are comparing total death toll, the bar graph should just show a cumulative number and not an average.\r\n……………………………………………………………………………………………………..\r\nAesthetics\r\nThe plot chart can be changed to reflect a more interactive model - perhaps a bubble chart which would have the name added as a tooltip instead of the names hard-coded in the graph as above. This makes the graph look untidy with names not very easy to read.\r\n……………………………………………………………………………………………………..\r\nThe plot chart can show the X-axis as the names vs Y-axis as the cumulative deaths in descending order to give a cleaner look. The label of the graph says top 5 district but the entire set of data is shown here. However, it would be ideal to compare the death numbers to positive cases to visualize the ratio. While the death number of Utara may be 1900, it would be good to know the total number of positive cases to compare if the rate itself is high.\r\n……………………………………………………………………………………………………..\r\nThe bar chart can also have the X-axis as the names vs y-axis as the cumulative deaths for the top 5 districts.The cumulative number of deaths is an addition of the previous days, weeks, months counts. A vertical chart would be more appropriate in addressing the gravity of the situation.\r\n2. With reference to the critics above, suggest alternative graphical presentation to improve the current design. Sketch out the proposed design. The proposed alternative design should include interactive techniques. Support your design by describing the advantages or which part of the issue(s) your alternative design try to overcome.\r\nA Bar chart would help if we need to consider the different types of Covid positive cases along with their treatment, isolation, healed, and death categories. Since we are only keen to explore the death data vs total positive cases for the districts, we will explore 2 types of charts - a bar graph (showing total death numbers by district) and an interactive bubble graph to show the death rate, recovery rate by district. For the bubble graph, we will further use a % to calculate the death rate and % of recovery in the district.\r\nIf a daily data was provided, we could have built a line chart by each district (interactive in nature) to show the progress on a daily basis. Since the data provided is a snapshot of 30th June, we will stick to the data. And if a population data was provided, we would have calculated the rate of covid to check if the covid is widespread in a particular district.\r\nThe below is the proposed sketch of how I visualize the dashboard to look like.This would show which districts have the high death toll. Then proceed to compare them further on the basis of recovery and death rate (in proportion to total covid cases) to determine the fatality rate in a district.\r\n\r\n3. Using Tableau, design the proposed data visualisation.\r\nPlease view the proposed data visualization in Tableau Public here\r\nThe final dashboard looks like below. \r\n4. Provide step-by-step description on how the data visualisation was prepared.\r\nThe data was extracted from Open Data Covid-19 Provinsi DKI Jakarta[https://riwayat-file-covid-19-dki-jakarta-jakartagis.hub.arcgis.com].\r\nBased on the data cleansing done (refer to “About the Data” section), we prepared a final file which was uploaded to Tableau. Our cleansing part is now done and we can use the worksheet tab to tabulate our interactive charts. For Data Visualization, it is seldom possible to add all the information in a single chart especially when there are multiple variables, districts and a large data set to view.\r\nThis is where an interactive charts become useful in providing us an overview and also a method to view singular data if we want.\r\n……………………………………………………………………………………………………..\r\nChart 1 - Covid Death Toll by City\r\nTo prepare the chart, we will drag the District Data worksheet as the data source.\r\nUnder the Sheet (renamed as Covid-City), we dragged the city names to Columns and Death data to rows.\r\n 3. The recommended bar chart is automatically formed. 4. We will use the descend button to sort the graph in descending order to show us which city has the highest Covid death toll. 5. Notice that the Death is a sum value indicating a cumulative number.\r\n\r\n……………………………………………………………………………………………………..\r\nChart 2 - Covid Death Toll by District\r\nUnder the Sheet (renamed as Covid-District), we dragged the district names to Columns and Death data to rows.\r\n\r\nThe recommended bar chart is automatically formed.\r\nWe will use the descend button to sort the graph in descending order to show us which district has the highest Covid death toll.\r\nNotice that the Death is a sum value indicating a cumulative number.\r\nThis graph would now show us the top 5 districts with highest covid deaths.\r\nThe district with highest covid deaths is labeled as “Proces Data Update”. Since this is not a real district, we will exclude this data to see which are the next 5 districts with highest Covid death toll.\r\nSimilarly, we shall exclude LUAR DKI JAKARTA - which appears to be an aggregated number and not really a district representation.\r\nIn order to exclude a field, we ill right click on the graph and click on exclude. The value will be hidden from the graph.\r\n\r\n ……………………………………………………………………………………………………..\r\nChart 3- Covid Death Toll by District: An Interactive Plot\r\nWhile is it interesting to know the highest death toll of covid positive people in the districts, it is more insightful if we can derive the death rate of the district.\r\nIn a new worksheet, we will drag and drop the covid positive cases to columns and death to rows.\r\nThereafter we will drag the district attribute to size pane.\r\nWe will exclude the “Process Update Data” and “Luar DKI Jakarta” by right clicking then selecting “exclude”.This will normalize the graph by excluding the outliers.\r\nWe would need to calculate the “Death Rate” by “Creating a new calculation” Formula is Death Rate / Covid Positive.\r\nWe will drag and add this attribute to the colour pane.\r\nUnder Death Rate, we will edit the colours to show the district with high death rate as bright red.\r\nThis is to show that even if the cumulative death number is high is a district, the death rate might be low indicating that the district does not really have a high rate of casualties of covid positive cases.\r\nWe have added a filter by district in case we want to drill down further and visualise the data by single/multiple districts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ……………………………………………………………………………………………………..\r\nChart 4 - Covid Death Rate compared to Covid Recovery Rate by District: An Interactive Plot\r\nSince the data is a snapshot of 30th Jun 2021, a time series or a line graph will not be a representation of the data. Which is why we used a bar graph to visualise the cumulative numbers. Additionally, an interactive bubble plot helped us visualise how a graph of death rate would look like and highlight any anomalies.\r\nIn a new worksheet, we will add a new calculation for recovery rate - (healed / covid positive) * 100\r\nDrag the death rate to rows and recovery rate to columns.\r\nAdd district to filters and filter out Proces Update Data and Luar DKI Jakarta.\r\nAdd recovery rate to colour pane.\r\nAdd district name to size.\r\nAdd total positive cases to tooltip.\r\nEdit the colour to reflect red and green only.\r\nAdd reference line to the x and y axis based on average values.\r\nReformat the axis to ensure only the range is reflected. This will normalize the graph and it will not look skewed. 10.Review the tooltip properties to edit as per below.\r\nFinal graph is ready.\r\n\r\n ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n5.Describe three major observations revealed by the data visualisation prepared.\r\nJakarta Utara is not the city with highest cumulative Covid deaths. It is Jakarta Timur. The original representation has incorrect visualization. By making a new bar graph in descending order, we get a clarity as to which city has the highest Covid death cases.\r\n ……………………………………………………………………………………………………..\r\nBased on the updated chart in descending order by district, we see that the top 5 districts have a death toll ranging from 362 to 257. The 5 districts are CENGKARENG, DUREN SAWIT, TANJUNG PRIOK, PASAR MINGGU and CAKUNG. This is again different from the original visualisation that reported DUREN SAWIT as the top district with Covid death. As per our graph, the district with highest death toll is CENKARENG.\r\n ……………………………………………………………………………………………………..\r\nOur 3rd graph provides us with insight on which districts have the highest covid cases along with high death rate. It is important to know the total covid cases to know the actual death rate and the impact. The graph shows that CENGKARENG, DUREN SAWIT appear to have high covid cases and deaths. An appropriate analysis would have been with the population to compare. It is natural that a district with high population would record higher covid cases than a district with lower covid cases.\r\n ……………………………………………………………………………………………………..\r\nEven though the absolute death numbers are high for the 5 districts listed above, the chart that compares recovery rate and death rate speaks another story. Based on the chart below, KEP.SERIPU SELATAN has the highest recovery rate and lowest death rate. On the other hand, MATRAMAN and JOHAR BARU have the highest death rate with recovery rate as one of the low ones.TAMBORA has the lowest recovery rate of all. Interestingly, none of the 3 districts featured in the journalist’s visualization.\r\n\r\nA time series data and population data would have enhanced our overall visualization. Given the limitations in the data, this was the best we could prepare “For Your Eyes Only”.\r\nDistill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web.\r\nLearn more about using Distill at https://rstudio.github.io/distill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nThe Task\r\n1. Critic the graph from both its clarity and aesthetics. At least three from each evaluation criterion.\r\n\r\nClarity\r\nOverall visualization does not depict if the export is more than the import or if the import is more than the export. Visually, we can only see colours patch and not much information. A bar chart / even a time series would have depicted this information better.\r\nEven though the x-axis says monthly data, the data shown in the graph is yearly data. Since the raw data is for a period of 2 years (by monthly data), a time series chart would be more helpful to check the trend of imports/exports in the 2 years’ period.\r\nGiven that the 6 countries’ graphs are shown separately, there is no single graph presented to show if the overall numbers have a trend. A graph for all 6 countries for exports and a graph for all 6 countries for imports would tell a different story.\r\nAesthetics\r\nThe graphical representation does not have a clear marking by month even thought the y-axis says the data is month of period. We can make the graph bigger to cover the data for 24 months (2 years) to show the trend.\r\nThe colours in the graph are overlapping and there is no clear demarcation to show the where the exports and imports exceed each other and under which month/year. This graph is visually not appealing.\r\nWhile dual axis helps to differentiate the data between import and export values, trade gap (export-import) data is required by economists to evaluate the difference and assess the gap.\r\n2. With reference to the critics above, suggest alternative graphical presentation to improve the current design. The proposed alternative data visualisation must be in static form. Sketch out the proposed design. Support your design by describing the advantages or which part of the issue(s) your alternative design try to overcome.\r\nI would propose to split the graph into 2 to show the time series between import and export. At the same time, I would calculate a trade gap to show when the gap was positive and negative.\r\nSketch of the proposed design below:\r\n\r\nThe advantages of a time series chart is that:\r\nIt shows the trend over a course of time taking into account the highs and lows of both imports and exports.\r\nThe time clearly depicts the trend that the trade is following for a particular country.\r\nThe advantages of a bar chart for the trade gap data is:\r\nGap analysis may be easily identified to show the economists where there is a shortfall in export/import as this directly impacts the GDP.\r\nThe months whereby the trade gap was positive or negative is easily visualized without any further calculations.\r\n3. Using Tableau, design the proposed data visualization.\r\nPlease view the proposed data visualization in Tableau Public here.\r\n4.Provide step-by-step description on how the data visualization was prepared.\r\nData Download:\r\nDownload the data from here [https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/trade-and-investment/merchandise-trade/latest-data] under region/market section.\r\nThe output consists of data across all countries for many years prior to 2021.\r\nData Cleansing:\r\nUsing the output file, we will do basic data filtering to use only the relevant data. We are only interested to review the data of countries - Mainland China, HongKong, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia and United States.\r\nWe will filter the 6 countries’ data and add it to a sheet labeled as “Combine”. The data is transposed in order to plot a time series easily. The data is further filtered to show only Jan 2019 to Dec 2020 data.All the countries’ data is added one after the other. We will only use the columns - Date, Import, Export, Country.\r\nMetadata Information: Date - Month and year of data Import - Import Value of the country Export - Export value of the country Country - To which country the value belongs to\r\n\r\nData Import to Tableau:\r\nWe will open Tableau 2021.1 version of desktop app. We will import the revised excel file “OutputFile_V1”. We will change the data type of Month/Year to “Date” type.\r\n\r\nData Visualisation Preparation for Static Graphs:\r\nWe will go to our first worksheet which has the attributes on the left. Our goal is to prepare a remodeled graph for each of the 6 countries in a static form.\r\nWe will build a trade gap graph and an import/export graph for the 6 countries.\r\nBuilding the Trade Gap graph:\r\nStep1 We need to derive a new field called Trade Gap. This is the difference between Export and Import values. We will use the “Create Quick Calculation” method to add the formula for trade gap and then a new attribute wil appear under “measure”.\r\n\r\nStep2 We will use the “Create calculated Field” to derive 2 new attributes: “Negative Trade Value” and “Positive Trade value”. These are just +/- numbers based on the trade gap formula.\r\n\r\nStep3 Add the country to the filter tab. We will use the filter to build a static dashboard for the respective country. For the 1st dashboard, filter the country.\r\nFor columns, add the Date by year, quarter and month. For Rows, we will add the Trade Gap.\r\n\r\nStep4 We will review the marks pane and perform the necessary changes to reflect the data correctly. Trade Gap would be dragged to “Colour”. Negative and Positive values will be added to “Details”. Overall structure will be changed to “Bar” to represent a bar graph.\r\n\r\nStep5 For the X-axis, change the range to fix it between 1/1/2019 and 31/12/2020. Change the name of the axis to Month/Year. The tick interval is set at 1 month.\r\nStep6 It is important to standardise the colour of the graph. We will use the Edit colour feature on the right side to make the changes. Red indicates negative trade value. Blue indicates a positive value.\r\n\r\nStep7 Edit the Worksheet title by double clicking on the title and editing the data in the edit title pane. Reflect the country by inserting the country sheet from the “Insert” function.\r\n\r\nStep8 CLick on the tool tip attribute to make further enhancements to our visual.\r\n\r\nStep9 The trade gap graph is now ready. Repeat this for all 6 countries to get the final trade gap graphs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding the country wise import/export values’ time series graph.\r\nStep1 Add the Month/Year under Column and Export / Import under Rows.\r\n\r\nStep2 Change the worksheet title to reflect the country by inserting the country sheet from the “Insert” function.\r\n\r\nStep3 Use the Mark Pane to make the changes to export and import lines. Export line is blue. Import line is orange. The type of the graph is line graph. The size is increased to define the density.\r\n\r\nStep4 You would notice that the export is on the y-axis on the left and import is on the y-axis on the right.\r\nStep5 For the X-axis, change the range to fix it between 1/1/2019 and 31/12/2020. Change the name of the axis to Month/Year. The tick interval is set at 1 month.\r\n\r\nStep6 For the y-axis, we may choose to shorten the graph by fixing the axis between 2 points. This value will vary between countries because some have long range while some have a short range starting only 300K. Since the final graph would be plotted on a single axis, we refrain from adjusting the y-axis values.\r\nStep7 The 1st time series graph is now ready. We repeat this for the 6 countries. Final output is shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.The final graphs of the 6 countries combined.\r\nIt is important to notice how visuals can change our assumption without looking at the data carefully. We will use the dashboard feature to combine the data and plot 2 graphs. It is essential to plot the 2 graphs separately as they are telling a different story.\r\n1 is a graph of import/export for the 6 countries. 1 is a trade gap graph for the 6 countries. Both the graphs are depicted for 2 years.\r\nStep1 We will open a new worksheet.This will be to compare the trade gap of the 6 countries in a single snapshot.\r\nStep2 We will add the Date under column and Trade Gap under rows.\r\nStep3 We will use the marks pane to add visual attributes to our graph. COuntries will be dragged to colours. Positive and Negative trade values will be dragged to details.\r\nStep4 Edit the X-axis to represent the right range of data.\r\nStep5 Edit the sheet title to show “2019-2020 Trade Gap Comparison by Countries”.\r\nStep6 Right click on the y-axis to add a reference line. We will fix it at the constant 0 to differentiate the positive and negative values.\r\nFinal Graph is ready as below.\r\n\r\nStep7 We will open a new worksheet.This will be to compare the import/export of the 6 countries in a single snapshot.\r\nStep8 We will add the Country, Year and Measure Names under column and Measure Values under rows. This step is important because we are trying to compare 2 measures - import and export against the 6 countries.\r\nStep9 We will use the marks pane to add visual attributes to our graph. Measure Values will be added to the colour pane to show different colour for import and export.\r\nStep10 Edit the X-axis to represent the right range of data.Since we are showing 6 countries’ data for 2 years, we will increase the ticker size to 1year to show only the yearly data. This is to ensure the graph looks neat and yet represents the correct information for the economists to evaluate.\r\nStep11 Edit the sheet title to show “2019-2020 Export/Import Data”. Final Graph is ready as below.\r\n\r\nThe Final Dashboard Using the dashboard feature, we will drag the 2 consolidated worksheets to the layout pane. In a single view, we can see the performance of import/export per country for the 2 years. At the same time, the graph below would show the countries where the trade gap is positive or negative.\r\n\r\n6. Describe three major observations revealed by the data visualisation prepared.\r\nThe benefits of a time series chart is that, it shows us a clear trend, gap and possible direction of the numbers. Benefits of the bar chart is that - it shows a clear demarcation of the data.\r\na) Export: - The export value of Mainland China declined sharply from Dec 2019 to Feb 2020. Then, it gradually increased. The absolute values of export are highest for Mainland China from Aug 2020 to Dec 2020.Looking at the overall 2019-2020 numbers, Mainland China had the highest export values. - The absolute export numbers are second highest for Hong Kong for 2019-2020. - The export values of United States is declining since Aug 2020.\r\nb) Import: - The import values of Hong Kong is the lowest, consistently for the 2 years. - It is interesting to see that China retains the highest import values in absolute terms given the size of the country.However, the exports are higher ensuring a positive trade gap. - Taiwan has higher import values than export values throughout 2019-2020 suggesting that Taiwan imports most of the goods into the country but does not export much.\r\nc) Gap Analysis: - Gap analysis reveals that Hong Kong has the highest positive trade balance. The exports have been higher than imports for the years 2019-2020. - Taiwan has the highest negative trade balance. Taiwan has high imports and the value of exports has not exceeded its import in 2019 and 2020.\r\nKey Links\r\nGithub: https://github.com/Amrita83\r\nNetlify:https://amritamishra.netlify.app/\r\nTableau:https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/amrita.mishra/viz/DataViz_1_May2021/TradeDashboard\r\nDistill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web.\r\nLearn more about using Distill at https://rstudio.github.io/distill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nThe Task\r\n1. Critic the graph from both its clarity and aesthetics. At least three from each evaluation criterion.\r\nSource: Department of Statistics, Singapore\r\n\r\nIntent of Graphical Representation: Provide Visual representation of Exports (Y-axis) and Imports (X-axis) i.e., Exports Vs Imports Value for multiple markets with respect to Singapore.\r\nData Inputs for producing visual representation is as follows: Input 1:Market Input 2:Imports Input 3:Exports\r\nPossible inferences include (Business values for each market in terms of Imports ($ Value) Vs Export ($Value)\r\nClarity\r\nOverall basic visual representation of data is unclear. It is unclear if the size of the bubble represents the size of the trade since the size of the bubble is relative to one another.\r\nAdding a white dot to the import/export region to represent net trade value is very unclear and does not indicate a trade surplus/deficit visually.\r\nSince each market is represented by a colour and there are many overlaps, it is unclear how a market is performing.\r\nDollar value represented on the graph seems to be total business value of import + export. Since only the overall trade value is represented on graph, it does not show a visual split of the import and export values.\r\nThe X-axis and Y-axis are misleading with no unit numbers or axis details mentioned. As a reader, I do not know whether the 80 means 80million, 80% or what attribute.\r\nThe graph seems static and we do not know for which period was the graph made. Ideally, a graph should show the trend if it is supposed to reflect growth. If the graph is indicative of trade for a particular year, the year details should be mentioned clearly.\r\nAesthetics\r\nColor coding for Thailand and EU seem very similar, including the labeling and the bubble representation. The colours could be made different (if a colour is absolutely needed).\r\nThe United States label seems to point to some data in the graph but visualization is unclear. Similar issues exists for Malaysia.\r\nBucketing / summing up the total trade value for both imports and exports does not represent the true trade affair of the country. It would be easier to show each country separately for a deep dive analysis of the import/export analysis. Alternatively, a trend line may be used to show the growth of trade (import/export) over the years to reflect the true nature of Singapore’s trade with its trading partners.\r\n2. With reference to the critics above, suggest alternative graphical presentation to improve the current design. Sketch out the proposed design. The proposed alternative design should include appropriate interactive techniques. Support your design by describing the advantages or which part of the issue(s) your alternative design try to overcome.\r\nIntent of Data Visualization can be better visualized by plotting using line graphs with different color coding of Nations/Countries and Dollar Values for Imports and Exports separately for each country. Final representation must enable Business User to identify Dollar Values of Each Country/Nation for their Import Vs Export to determine the nett trade.\r\n\r\n3. Using Tableau, design the proposed data visualization.\r\nPlease view the proposed data visualization in Tableau Public here\r\n4.Provide step-by-step description on how the data visualization was prepared.\r\nData Download:\r\nDownload the data from here [https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/trade-and-investment/merchandise-trade/latest-data] under region/market section.\r\nThe output consists of data across all countries for many years prior to 2021.\r\nData Cleansing:\r\nMetadata Information: Date - Month and year of data Import - Import Value of the country Export - Export value of the country Country - To which market the value belongs to\r\nOnce the data is extracted, we will filter out the 10 markets’ data along with the import/export values for 2011Jan -2020 Dec. \r\nThis step can also be carried out in Tableau by importing the 2 excel tabs T1 and T2, joining them together.\r\nAfter which, a formula can be added to join the records from T1 = T2.\r\nOnce the records are joined, we review the data type and convert all the import and export values to “Numeric” and check on the “Month/Year” data type to Date format.\r\nOur cleansing part is now done and we can use the worksheet tab to tabulate our interactive charts. For Data Visualisation, it is seldom possible to add all the information in a single chart especially when there are multiple variables, markets and 10 years worth of data to view.\r\nThis is where an interactive charts become useful in providing us an overview and also a method to view singular data if we want.\r\nTableau Preparation\r\nChart 1: Performance by Country Our 1st chart is to perform interactive chart by market for the 10years for import and export data.\r\nWe drag the countries attribute to “Filters” section. Ensure to select only the 10 required countries that we need.\r\nWe drag Year to Columns and Sum(Export) & Sum(Import) to Rows.\r\nUnder the marks pane, we select the graph as line.\r\nWe drag the measure names to colour pane.\r\nCheck if both Export and Import panes are reflecting the above configuration.\r\nWe need to synchronise the axis to reflect the correct data.\r\nWe edit the countries’ filter by adding “Show Filter”. This will populate a chart on the right which allows us to click multiple values. We are only interested in seeing the deep dived data for a single market. Hence, we will change the show filter to a single radio button.\r\nOur market wise interactive chart is ready to see how each of the market performed in the last 10 years.\r\nChart 2: Trade Gap by Year For the 2nd chart, we will check how the trade gap perform for each of the 10 markets by the years. Since we want to see all the 10 countries together, we will apply a year wise filter.\r\nDrag the year attribute to filter pane. Ensure you select only 2011 Jan to 2020 Dec data.\r\nWe need to calculate Trade Gap which is the Sum(Export)-Sum(Import). We will use the formula under Analysis to create this new calculated attribute.\r\nOur target is to make a bubble chart to show all the markets by year. The bubbles will be coloured based on their deficit type. If export is > import, then trade deficit is positive and will be green. If trade deficit is negative, the colour will be red. It is worth knowing that the deficit with a market is from Singapore perspective only.It does not mean that the respective market has a trade deficit.\r\nWe shall drag the Trade Gap attribute to Size, then again to colour. We shall add the Country to Details.\r\nUsing the Filter attribute, we will “Show Filter” for the years. A multi select chart will open up. We will change it to single value radio button.\r\nUnder the colours, we will edit the colours to reflect red and green and only 2 solid colours with mid-point being 0.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChart 3: Trade Gap by Analysis - Single Dashboard A single dashboard view would certainly tell us how each country performed in relation to one another within the period of 10 years. It is indeed tough to consolidate a single view without compromising on the overall data analysis.\r\nWe will use the attribute calculated earlier - Trade Grap to perform the analysis here.\r\nDrag country and year to the filter pane. We need to use these 2 attributes to filter out information later.\r\nDrag the country and year to the column tab. Drag the Trade Gap to the row tab.\r\nAdd the Trade Gap to the colour pane.\r\nChange the type of graph to Line graph.\r\nUse the show filter attribute for both country and year. Then select the single value radio button.\r\nEnsure the Trade Gap colour is dual solid colour - red and blue only with 0 as mid axis point.\r\nThe toop tip is important to show the correct data as we hover the cursor to various points. Once the tooltip is activated, the trade gap value will be shown in the graph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChart 4: Trade Summary by Country for 2011-2020 Since our original chart was a bubble type, we wil try and recreate a similar chart making it neater and more interactive. The above charts are helpful to us in determining what comprises of the trade data in the last 10 years with different views.\r\nDrag country and year to the filter pane. We need to use these 2 attributes to filter out information later.\r\nDrag the Sum(Export) to rows and sum(Import) to Columns of the graph builder.\r\nUse the Marks pane to add Trade Gap to Colour, Trade Gap again to Tooltip, Country to Size, Country again to Label.\r\nUse the show filter attribute to show the country and years on right side. For Countries, we will retain the multiple filter. For Years, we will retain the single value radio button. Thsi is because we want to see only 1 year at a time but for all / many countries together. This would look like a nice interactive scaatter plot.\r\nUsing the edit colour function, we will change the colour to 2 solid tone with a mid value axis at 0.\r\nWhen you change the year, you would see the bubbles move. It would show on a particular year, what was the trade gap (surplus/deficit). Blue indicates surplus. Red indicates deficit.\r\n\r\nThe Final Dashbaord\r\nWe have prepared an interactive dashboard that retains the original design and also clearly highlights the import/export data of the 10 markets by years 2011-2020. The dashboard is interactive with radio buttons which allow the user to deep dive to a particular year to see the data. We drag the Chart 4 to our dashboard panel to prepare the interactive dashboard. This dashboard is saved in Tableau Public for data enthusiasts to view.\r\n\r\n5. Describe three major observations revealed by the data visualisation prepared.\r\nTaiwan: The import of Taiwan has been higher than exports consistently since 2011-2020. There was an import dip in the year 2016 but effective 2017, the import went up. It has the highest import in comparison to the remaining 9 markets.\r\n\r\nHong Kong: In contrast, Hong Kong has the highest export values consistently since 2011-2020.The values once reached 65.7M in 2018 (the highest export values recorded when compared to other markets). It is interesting to note that COVID has no impact on trade for this market.\r\n\r\nMainland China: As per the original graph, it looks like Mainland China has the highest import and export values. While the absolute values of import and export is indeed the highest, the trade gap between export and import is not high for Mainland China.It is interesting to note that other countries like Indonesia and Malaysia have a higher or equal trade gap suggesting that Singapore probably imports more from Indonesia and Malaysia than exports to them. Whereas, Singapore’s import/export values with China is on par. After 2019, the import values seem to decline possibly owing to COVID reasons\r\n\r\nUnited States: It is interesting to see that United States does not have large import / export values or a large trade gap. However, since Covid started, Singapore exported a lot of goods out to the US. Since mid-2020, the export values have overtaken the import values.The trade gap has shrunk over the last 10years while the overall trade exports have grown.\r\n\r\nMalaysia: Since the onset of COVID, trade with Malaysia has entered into a deficit. This is possible due to many household goods which are imported from Malaysia. There is constantly a rising demand of household goods in Singapore due to circuit breaker / restrictions of travelling out of the country. Demand of groceries and eatables have gone up.\r\n\r\nEU: While EU is actually large and comprises of many countries, the trade with EU is the lowest, hovering around 30-60K (’000) only.This indicates that Singapore may have its own favourities for trading and mostly the neighbouring countries are prominent trading partners.\r\n\r\nTrading Partners: In the last 10 years, Mainland China and Malaysia have remained as the top 2 trading partners of Singapore. It is interesting to see that the trading volume has indeed increased over the last 10years to cater to the growing demands of the increasing population. What would be interesting to note is the type of merchandise that is traded by these markets and the specific trends in the last 10years. Due to COVID, many trading partners experienced uncertain times and hence possibly erratic volumes. We may want to perform additional analysis to check how the market trend will be in the post-COVID world.\r\nKey Links\r\nGithub: https://github.com/Amrita83 Netlify:https://amritamishradatablog.netlify.app Tableau:https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/amrita.mishra/viz/Tableau_DataViz2/TradeDashboard\r\nDistill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web.\r\nLearn more about using Distill at https://rstudio.github.io/distill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\r\n3.1 Importing Data\r\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\r\nR code\r\nwine <- read_csv(“data/wine_quality.csv”)\r\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\r\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\r\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted by using ggplot() and geom_histogram() of ggplot2 package. Then, ggarrange() of ggpubr package is used to patch these histogram into a single figure to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\r\nRcode\r\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= fixed acidity)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) va <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= volatile acidity)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) ca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= citric acid)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) rs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= residual sugar)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) ch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= chlorides)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) fSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= free sulfur dioxide)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) tSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= total sulfur dioxide)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) density <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) pH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) sulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) alcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”)\r\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\r\nDistill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web.\r\nLearn more about using Distill at https://rstudio.github.io/distill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
